# The frontend of Scalperz's store
### A joint effort by Fredrik Wasström, Dilan Zibari, Sigrid Hallik and Christian Sandqvist

## Scalperz Store
A complete storefront with product listing, cart, checkout.

## Brief technical description
This repo houses the necessary files to run the store. The frontend gets products, inventory, user data and cart data from various APIs in a microservices architecture manner. The store itself is built on React and uses Axios to make requests. Session data is stored in a cookie. The frontend is deployed to https://scalperz-store.herokuapp.com/.

Info about React can be found in the wiki https://github.com/FrediWa/scalperz-store/wiki/React-info.

## Team
The team consists of:
- Fredrik Wasström – Team lead and product listing
- Dilan Zibari – Login and routing
- Sigrid Hallik – Checkout
- Christian Sandqvist – Cart

Majority of communication has been done through Discord and subtasks have been managed through the issues and the project board of this repo.
